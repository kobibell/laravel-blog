### Laravel Blog Project

This is a blog built from using Laravel and Vite to test the functionality of Laravel and how to full scale this to make web applications.

### Requirements

Since this is using Laravel, you'll need a compatible environment.

See the Laravel installation docs for detailed instructions: [https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation)

If you are using MacOS, you could also use Laravel Herd. For more information: [https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/getting-started/installation](https://herd.laravel.com/docs/1/getting-started/installation)

### Installation

Make sure your environment is configured as described in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

1. In your terminal, go to your project folder
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as necessary (local URL, database connection, etc)
5. Run `npm run dev`
6. Run `php artisan serve`

You can now checkout the project by going to `127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
